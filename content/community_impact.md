# The Fund:

Little Law’s Big Dreams is an organization that was initiated upon the accidental death of Michael Law. Michael was a spirited individual who valued hometown connectedness, yet he possessed larger-than-life ambition. 
Michael’s family and friends want to ensure that his chutzpah remains present and everlasting in the area he was raised, the place he chose to reside, and the town he began a series of businesses in after traveling the world while serving his country in the Air Force.

The LLBD organization is committed to encouraging others to venture towards his or her dreams and will leverage and share resources to make each trip along Main Street a more enjoyable journey. 
Additionally, Michael enhanced lives wherever he traveled, so the LLBD embodies a natural sense to improve community surroundings. 
Through supporting community improvement it is our belief other young entrepreneurs will also pursue their dreams with vigor. 
In doing so, the town’s history and natural beauty can be preserved, and Michael’s spirit will become everlasting. 
Little Laws Big Dreams currently supports an endowed scholarship fund in Michael's name at SUNY Cobleskill.
